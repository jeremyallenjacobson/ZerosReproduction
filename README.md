# ZerosReproduction

In this project, we demonstrate in a Jupyter notebook how to use Python to reproduce the image from page 319 of the paper
**Zeros of polynomials with 0,1 coefficients'**, B. Poonen, A.M. Odlyzko. *L'Enseignement Math.* **39** (1993), 317-348.

Github also has a viewer for Jupyter notebooks. To view the notebook from the Github project page, click on the PoonenOdlyzkoZerosFigureReproducedPython.ipynb file.

If you have python and Jupyter notebook installed on your computer, then you can download the .ipynb file and run it on your computer to make new images.
