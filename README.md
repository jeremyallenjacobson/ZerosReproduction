# ZerosReproduction

In this project, we demonstrate in a Jupyter notebook (the .ipynb file) how to use python to reproduce the image from page 319 of the paper
**Zeros of polynomials with 0,1 coefficients'**, B. Poonen, A.M. Odlyzko. *L'Enseignement Math.* **39** (1993), 317-348.

Github has a viewer for Jupyter notebooks. To see the code from the Github project page, click on the PoonenOdlyzkoZerosFigureReproducedPython.ipynb file.

Alternatively, you can download the.html file from the project page and open it in your browser to display the output that you would see if you were to run each cell in the notebook.

If you have python and jupyter notebook installed on your computer, then you can download the .ipynb file and run it on your computer to make new images.
