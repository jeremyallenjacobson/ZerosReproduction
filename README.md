The Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file demonstrates how to use python to easily reproduce the image from page 319 of the paper
**Zeros of polynomials with 0,1 coefficients'**, B. Poonen, A.M. Odlyzko. *L'Enseignement Math.* **39** (1993), 317-348.

If you don't have python and jupyter notebook installed on your computer, then you can open the .html file in your browser which displays the output that you would see if you were to run each cell.
